# App Modernization with AWS Fargate(ECS) and MongoDB Atlas

## Introduction: 
This is a technical repo to demonstrate the application deployment using MongoDB Atlas and AWS Fargate.
This tuotorial is intended for those who wants to
1. Serverless Application Deployment for Production Environment
2. Production deployment to auto scale, HA and Security
3. Agile development of application moderinzation
4. Deployment of containerized application in AWS
5. Want to try out the AWS Fargate and MongoDB Atlas 

## [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) 
MongoDB Atlas is an all purpose database having features like Document Model, Geo-spatial , Time-seires, hybrid deployment, multi cloud services.
It evolved as "Developer Data Platform", intended to reduce the developers workload on development and management the database environment.
It also provide a free tier to test out the application / database features.


## [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. AWS Fargate is compatible with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

## Step by Step Fargate Deployment:

**Step3: Set up the VPC, Subnet, NAT Gateway**

**Step4: Set up the Internet Gateway(IGW) **

**Step5: Set up the RouteTable**

**Step6: Set up ECS Cluster**

**Step7: Testing the Application**


## Summary:

 Any contanirized application can be deployed within no time using this template. 
 Instead of ebsdemoapp.zip , you can use your application zip file and deploy the application.
